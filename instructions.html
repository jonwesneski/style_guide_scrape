                </li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Advanced Filter Settings</h3>
            <p>Here are the advanced settings to help filter down to what kind of images you are looking for:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        image-url-sub-path: A common pattern is to put images into a certain path to group them together, for example:<br>
                        https://www.mycdn.com/shop/files/flagship.jpg<br>
                        https://www.mycdn.com/shop/files/redshirt.jpg<br>

                        Both of these are inside "shop/files" at "https://www.mycdn.com"<br>
                        If there are other images, for example:
                        https://www.mycdn.com/common/files/mylogo.jpg<br>
                        It will not be downloaded<br><br>

                        *If you just want to grab all images you can set this setting to: /
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        min-image-size-kb: Images come in all dimensions and sizes, and a website may have several images that
                        are not "style guide" images, like a logo, some custom UI thing, or even a much smaller thumbnail
                        of what you actually want. To help filter these out you can see what the average image size and
                        use that as a setting here<br><br>
                        
                        *Also note that some sites might have bigger than expected image sizes, so you may have to increase
                        the image size setting for those sites
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        file-extensions: There are many image file extensions out there: .jpg, .jpeg, .png are some of the
                        common ones. To filter to the ones you want you can set this. Determining the file extension
                        is looking at the url itself and seeing what the url path ends with a "dot something", for example:<br>
                        https://www.mycdn.com/shop/files/flagship.jpg - This one is .jpg<br>
                        https://www.mycdn.com/shop/files/flagship.png - This one is .png<br><br>

                        To grab just one type of file extension it is simply a .jpg or a .png or whatever the
                        file extension is<br><br>

                        To grab more than one type, include a comma between the different types:<br>
                        .jpg,.png,.jpeg
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
